Respected Sir,
This to inform you that I am a student of your school studying in class <class><section>. I had opt for <stream1> stream but now I am finding it difficult to study. My Unit Assessment-I results were very bad and I had scored passing marks in <stream1>. I am finding <stream1> to be very tough and hence want to change my stream to <stream2>. I have attended some tutorial classes of <stream2> and was amazed to find that I could score well in this subject. As it is only the beginning of Class <class>, I will not face much difficulty to deal with the previous portions of the <stream2> subjects.

Therefore I request you to allow me to change my stream to commerce, for which I shall be obliged.

Thanking you,
Yours faithfully,
